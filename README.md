## 1. Case Study #1 - When Was the Golden Age of Video Games
<img width="200" src="https://github.com/tuuyen13/SQL-Projects/assets/94332486/87617be1-1c96-4619-8702-84a3904829df" align="center">

Video games are big business: the global gaming market is projected to be worth more than $300 billion by 2027 according to <a href="https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/global-gaming-market">Mordor Intelligence</a>. With so much money at stake, the major game publishers are hugely incentivized to create the next big hit. But are games getting better, or has the golden age of video games already passed?</p>
In this project, we'll explore the top 400 best-selling video games created between 1977 and 2020. We'll compare a dataset on game sales with critics and user reviews to determine whether or not video games have improved as the gaming market has grown.</p>
Our database contains two tables. We've limited each table to 400 rows for this project, but you can find the complete dataset with over 13,000 games on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/holmjason2/videogamedata">Kaggle</a>. </p>

## 2. Case Study #2 - Covid Data Exploration

## 3. Case Study #3 - Analyzing NYC Public School Test Result Scores
![Uploading schoolbus.jpgâ€¦]()

Every year, American high school students take SATs, which are standardized tests intended to measure literacy, numeracy, and writing skills. There are three sections - reading, math, and writing, each with a maximum score of 800 points. These tests are extremely important for students and colleges, as they play a pivotal role in the admissions process.

Analyzing the performance of schools is important for a variety of stakeholders, including policy and education professionals, researchers, government, and even parents considering which school their children should attend. 

In this notebook, we will take a look at data on SATs across public schools in New York City. Our database contains a single table:
<h3 id="schools"><code>schools</code></h3>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>column</th>
<th>type</th>
<th>description</th>

<tr>
<td><code>school_name</code></td>
<td><code>varchar</code></td>

<td>Borough that the school is located in</td>

<td><code>building_code</code></td>
